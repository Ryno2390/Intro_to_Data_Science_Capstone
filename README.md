# Intro_to_Data_Science_Capstone
Capstone Project for Springboard "Intro to Data Science" course.
This project seeks to emulate the FiveThirtyEight political forecasting model by analyzing raw polling data during the 2016 presidential election in order to provide actionable intelligence to the Clinton campaign (my hypothetical client) as well as make state by state predictions to determine the most likely winner.
